# OSProject4

Most of these files I don't think we actually need. Beleive most are examples from prof.

Real ones to worry about msf.c (client side calls to the lib) and serverlib.c (server side handeling of the client request)


^^ changed to libmfs.c so it works with the make file to make a shared lib (from lecture example code)
